# Brainf*ck Compiler

This is a compiler for the toy language [Brainf*ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). This compiler uses base code from a compiler course I took at UT where I built a Pascal compiler. Since Brainf*ck is a much smaller, simpler language, this project was fairly simple comparitively.

Brainf*ck uses a tape to store its data so operations can happen on either the tape head or the contents of a tape cell.

An overview of the grammar can be found in the grammar.txt file.
